        ```

    2. Activate the virtual environment:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    3. If the virtual environment activation fails with the following error 
        ```bash
        FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
        ```

        Run the followiung command to fix it
        ```bash
        Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
        ```

    4. Install dependencies and run the script
